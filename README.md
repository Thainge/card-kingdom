# Getting Started with Create React App
CopyRight 2022 Tobey Hainge

This is a fully fledged card game made purely from react!
Download the repository and run it to play it locally or visit the website directly on the right.

I spent around a month working on this project and had a few art designers help assist me with art creation for this game.

I also plan on hooking this game up to Node Sockets to allow players to connect to others and battle eachother.
Next steps:
- Node Sockets multiplayer access
