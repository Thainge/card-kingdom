Fully functional card game made purely from React. Also uses NodeJS for a sockets connection for multiplayer access.
  - Sockets.io
  - NodeJS
  - ReactJS

This project took around a month to complete and has turned out to be a very fun web card game, in the future I plan on releasing a better version built in Unity.

Next steps:
- Unity version
