Fully functional card game made purely from React. Earn gold and stars to purchase booster packs and unlock upgrades to enhance your gameplay. Defeat your opponnents and take back the land. Also compete with other players by joining a multiplayer lobby!

In order to run the multiplayer I have hosted a server on Heroku to allow multiplayer access, enjoy!

This project took around a month to complete and has turned out to be a very fun web card game, in the future I plan on releasing a better version built in Unity.

Next steps:
- Unity version
